##### Shannon Xu

From Silicon Valley world-known tech giants to unicorn startup that went to acquisition, Shannon Xu has worked in tech industries for many years as a Software Engineer. Being brought up in an atheistic education system since childhood, she did not have any beliefs in the existence of God or gods. However, life is always unexpected and often filled with surprises. At the age of 28, Shannon started to have many intense spiritual awakening experiences, which shook her realities completely and finally led her onto the lifelong exploration of mankind's ultimate question ---

>Who am I?
 
Shannon does not have a firm answer to this question till this moment. Truth be told, there is no answer and this question is unknowable to mankinds. However, one can directly experience the answer when one is truly ready.

Shannon quitted her tech job after a few years since her initial awakenings, and made a big shift in every aspect of her mundane life. Now she works as a energy healer and spiritual teacher in the domains of metaphysics and spirituality. Under the loving guidance of Christ consciousness, she also became an ordained minister at Church of Natural Grace, with interfaith beliefs in Oneness, Truth, Love, Compassion and Forgiveness.

In Shannon's spare time, she loves to immerse herself in Mother Nature and gets to the mountains and waters. You may run into her on one of the hiking trails in the Bay Area. Other times, she stays at her home playing the Chinese Qin (Guqin), taking care of her little garden of flowers and vegetables, with her cat Momo.

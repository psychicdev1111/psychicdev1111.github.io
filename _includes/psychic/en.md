When you come to the word “Psychic”...

>Emm… Tarot cards? Gypsy ladies? Palm readings?\
Or… Crystal balls? Candles?  Some sort of colorful elixirs in little bottles?\
Or… The big “PSYCHIC” sign along a local drive or outside of a local store window?\
Or… Superpowers? Clairvoyance abilities? Telepathy? Precognition?\
Or… Black magics? Mediumships? Possessions?\
… 

You may see this word on the street a lot. You may be too familiar with this word as it’s also everywhere on the TV and Internet. When you see it, probably all those paranormal stuff and fantasies immediately come to your mind. You may be skeptical about it and think of it as some sort of woo-woo nonsense, or you may believe it and even have fear raised in your heart.

Yes, this word “PSYCHIC” is very controversial in our societies, it easily triggers subtle emotions and judgements in both the non-believers and the believers. So why does Shannon, a “serious” spiritual/truth seeker, choose such a controversial word for herself and talk about it here on a separate page? Well, besides the domain name is super easy to remember, it also triggers most people, and that’s why it's a perfect scenario for your growth. Once Shannon asked God/Oneness if this is a suitable domain name, and the answer she got was, **no difference**. And this page is indeed for serious spiritual/truth seekers only.

Why does Shannon want to trigger you? Of course she doesn’t want you to be bothered by a word. But we humans all do. You just have to be really honest with yourself. You have to be aware of whether you are triggered by this one single word, and to what extent. Now you have a great opportunity to take a look at your inner self on this issue. What’s your feeling about it in your body? Why do you feel this way? What’s your definition of it in your mind? Where does it come from? What’s your belief around psychic phenomenons and ESP abilities? And how does that form in your current life?

These answers are very important to your spiritual growth. And in the process of dipping deep into yourself and finding out the answers, you will shed off many layers of false perceptions about Truth, and heal yourself. You may be shocked to see a lot of wounds and mind programs from your family, schools, culture, society in this life, and you may see even deeper from your religional and ancestral lineages which spread over many lifetimes, it went on and on. This technique is only good for spiritual-mature people. It is called [**Atma Vichara --- Self-Inquiry**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-enquiry_(Ramana_Maharshi)), and it will eventually lead you to the ultimate question of **Who am I** when you are ready.

Walking on her spiritual path for many lifetimes, Shannon has seen so many spiritual seekers trapped with psychic abilities pursuit or rejections. She herself had many lessons on this topic as well. People always go to two extremes in this world of polarities when it comes to psychic abilities and mystic experiences, either desiring them, regarding them as a criteria for spiritual progress and achievement, or resisting and even condemning them in a huge fear with the unrealized statement of “everything is illusion and there is only the Void” backing them up, afraid of being opened up to the unknown. Unfortunately, either way will not lead into deeper realizations of Truth.

Psychic abilities are human being’s innate abilities. People are born with these abilities in this world, you may hear about little children always talking to their “imaginative”  friends and angels all the time. However, as people grow up, these abilities are shadowed by their conditioned minds through brainwashes of family, schools, society and so on. Adults with these abilities are getting rare and precious. It even becomes a mystery and miracle in this world, and sometimes people with these abilities are not accepted by the general public. But it should be the other way around. Everyone’s daily life should be full of miracles, and that should be the true norm for human beings instead.

The way back to our true selves is not an easy journey. Due to many layers of false perceptions of Truth for many lifetimes in many spacetime incarnations, most people on Earth now won’t be able to even wake up in their current lives, not to mention to reclaim their innate psychic abilities. This is not pessimistic, this is just a fact. The only thing we can do is, **do not resist, take it easy**. With neutrality, one allows God to lead the self to the places one supposes to be at each moment. **Trust and surrender to our true selves**. If any spiritual gifts are reclaimed by you along your way home, that is good, if not, that is also good. **No problem at all, and all is well**. Yes, they are indeed all illusions. Why force yourself into some sort of expectations? When you have a spiritual gift but you measure it with other people’s rules and definitions, can you really recognize your gift? **You are already perfect**. Remember, **the only superpower in this matrix is LOVE**. This may sound cliché, but it will be still true even when this matrix upgrades to its next version.

Similarly, for every controversial word and concept you can also apply this technique of self-inquiry in your meditation.

>How about God?\
How about Ghost?\
How about Demon?\
How about Religion?\
How about Death?\
How about Darkness?\
How about  …

Try it out. Allow the words return to a **neutral and non-judgemental** state in you. If you are not able to do so immediately, give yourself acceptance and compassion too. **It is all okay.**
